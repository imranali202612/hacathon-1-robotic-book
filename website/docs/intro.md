# Welcome to Physical AI Book

This book teaches AI engineers how to integrate AI software with humanoid robot bodies - bridging the gap between machine learning models and physical systems.

## What You'll Learn

This book covers the essential knowledge for building Physical AI systems:

- **ROS 2**: The robotic "nervous system" that connects AI software to hardware
- **Python Integration**: Using rclpy to create AI control nodes
- **Robot Structure**: Understanding URDF for humanoid robot kinematics
- **Motion Planning**: Planning safe, efficient robot movements
- **Simulation**: Testing AI in realistic virtual environments before real-world deployment

## Start Learning

[Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](./module1-ros2-nervous-system/)

Learn how ROS 2 enables communication between AI software (the "brain") and robot hardware (the "body").
